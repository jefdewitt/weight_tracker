# weight-tracker-keeper

## Purpose

The goal of this app is to help people reach lifestyle goals by tracking their weight. This helps meet the need of personal improvement and better health.

## UI 

Screens featured in the include sign-in, weight grid, permissions and notifications. These screens prioritized a user-centric interface and were successful in creating simple navigation, clear data presentation and easy-to-use core functionality. 

## Coding Approach

Using an iterative development process, engineering the main, bare bones, functional components first. Each subsequent iteration of development allowed me to refine my previous work and polish functionality and layouts. This process is important to create a manageable workflow and revealed areas requiring more attention/effort to organically rise to the surface.

## Overcoming Challenges

The big thing I learned from my experience working on my first Android project pertains to the use of fragments. I built an app that uses bottom navigation and incorporating many fragments that are interchanged by a governing activity was very hard work for me, initially. Developing an instinct for when to use fragments as reusable components will take time. This project gave me a good baseline understanding and I’ll be building on that skill into the future.

## Big Win

Incorporating the backend services and database code was a huge success. I have a background in front-end work. Building out all the pieces for a full-stack application demonstrated my growth as a develop and I’m particularly proud of that accomplishment.
